# PhpCsFixer and Git Hooks

This repository is the source for Php Cs Fixer installation to your project. It uses brainmaestro/composer-git-hooks and friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer for its purpose and creates only wrapper for this packages.

First you need to require this composer package: 

```
composer require --dev brackets/code-style-fixer
```

Next you have to add this to script section of `composer.json`

```
"scripts": {
    ...
    "post-install-cmd": [
        ...
        "[ $COMPOSER_DEV_MODE -eq 0 ] || ./vendor/bin/code-style-fixer.sh git-hooks-add --ignore-lock"
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        ...
        "[ $COMPOSER_DEV_MODE -eq 0 ] || ./vendor/bin/code-style-fixer.sh git-hooks-update"
    ]
}
```

And then you have to install the package

```
./vendor/bin/code-style-fixer.sh install
```

Now you should have installed the package and on every pre-commit the fixer will run. On every pre-push the fixer will run, but only to check if everything is ok. If not, push will fail.
